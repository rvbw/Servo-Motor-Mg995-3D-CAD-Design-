# What is this?
This is a custom-designed Mounting Bracket (Holder) specifically engineered for the MG995 High-Torque Servo Motor. It was designed using Onshape to provide a precise and secure fit for standard-sized servos.

# What is its purpose?
The main purpose of this holder is to act as a bridge between the motor and your project's chassis. Its key benefits include:

-Secure Attachment: It allows you to firmly bolt the servo motor to any flat surface, robotic arm, or RC vehicle frame.
-Enhanced Stability: By holding the motor body tightly, it prevents vibration and unwanted shifting during high-torque movements.
-Easy Integration: It features pre-aligned screw holes that match the MG995's dimensions, making the assembly process much faster and more professional.
-Durability: It protects the plastic tabs of the servo from snapping by distributing the mechanical stress across the entire bracket.
